# Python for EM Guide

This is a `mdBook` project detailing advice for those new to scientific Python about using Python for electron
microscopy data analysis. It does not aim to teach the Python programming language. It fills in all the gaps left
by a typical introduction to Python. It covers IDEs, environments and Conda, a brief tour of the most important Python
packages for scientific analysis etc.

## mdBook

This book is written in `Markdown` pages and compiled into a series of webpages using `mdBook`. The documentation for
this can be found [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html).

To install mdBook, Rust must first be installed. This can be done with a single-line in a CLI (see
[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). mdBook can then be installed using a single CLI command found
[here](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html).

Details on how to serve a book locally, to compile and an overview of the project structure can be found
